The data that we have is 1000 simulated spectra of galaxies. A spectrum is a high resolution chart or graph that shows the intensity of light being emitted over a range of wavelengths. Galaxies consist of many different components, such as stars, gases, and dust. These physical properties leave a different and specific imprint on the galaxy’s spectral energy distribution. It is our hypothesis that these properties of galaxies can be determined empirically by analyzing spectral data gathered from such galaxies. We employed Machine Learning tools to determine the degree that a galaxy’s spectral energy distribution is correlated with each of the four properties being analyzed. Our results show that there exists a very strong correlation between the mass of a galaxy and its spectral energy distribution. For the dust and age properties of galaxies, a relatively strong correlation was also observed. In the case of tau, our results seem to indicate that a galaxy’s tau has little to no correlation with its spectral energy distribution. Some ways we could improve our results include using more advanced machine learning techniques and increasing the size and/or quality of our dataset.
